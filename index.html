                <h3>Ruby developer. Musician. Traveler.</h3>
                <p>Idea of learning how to code came to my mind last year. After 3 years working as a Customer Support and Team Lead I noticed that work I'm doing doesn't satisfy me anymore. I started to think about what kind of job would fulfil me, in terms of doing something meaningful, stretch my brain, keep learning new things and developing myself. I was lucky to meet person who inspired me and I realized that it's never too late to learn new skills. At the same time I bought saxophone and started to learn how to play that :D </p>
                <p>I've found a Skillcrush course and decided to take their Break into Tech course. I've started with basics: HTML, CSS, Git & GitHub. After that Responsive Web Design and basics of JavaScript and jQuery. Throughout the course I felt that back-end programming suits me better and I continued with Ruby on Rails course. I've learned Ruby language, Sinatra and eventually Rails. All of this while having full-time job. It was a busy time, but I learned I’m capable of pretty much anything if I put my mind to it. You can find all my projects in Portfolio section.</p>
                <p>Saxophone isn't only instrument I play. Since I was a kid I was learning to play flute. At the age of 16 I won a music school competition and was the best flute player in Czech Republic. And I'm already 12 years flute player in Májovak Symphonic Band - the oldest wind orchestra in Czech Republic. I also know few songs on piano and play peruvian flute quena which I bought last year in Peru.</p>
                <p>I traveled through 40 countries already, have a scratch-off map in my room and collection of magnets from each of countries I've been too. I like to meet people and learn about the country from locals, that's why mostly I do hitchhiking and use couchsurfing.org to find a place to stay. So far I traveled with my dear friend. One day I would like to try traveling solo too.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Hi, I am Daniela. And I am so excited to work with you.</p>
